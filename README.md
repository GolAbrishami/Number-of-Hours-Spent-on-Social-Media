# Number of Hours Spent on Social

## Overview¶

Social Media has changed the way we communicate, in ways of creating a sense of urgency and a need to share, providing an inside perspective of faraway places, and making Digital messages more personal. Robert Lustig, professor at the University of Southern California and author of *The Hacking* of the American Mind said \"kids are definitely addicted. It\’s not a drug, but it might as well be. It works the same way… it has the same results.\" Also, Companies, including Google and Apple, have said they will introduce features to help parents and kids monitor and manage their time online. We feel that looking into hours spent on social media is very fitting.

I and my partners investigated a linear
relationship between different factors and **spending hours on
social media**. 

We used convenience sampling to create our
dataset. 


| Attributes     | Description |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| age      | age | 
| gender      | male and female | 
| occupation | Business, Engineer, etc.     |
|marital_status|married and single|
|education|Associate degree, master degree, doctor degree, etc.|
|NSM|Numbers of social medias that a respondent has|
|HPD|Hours spent on social media per day|

We have four different approaches to the hypothesis:
  
1. Age and number of social media accounts as predictors.
2. Aage, number of social media accounts, Occupation, Marital status, Education
3. Age, gender, and a number of social media accounts as the explanatory variables.
4. Gender and age as explanatory variables.

We investigate the relation between the independent variables and the dependent variable in the dataset in three ways:

1. Using the coefficient of determination and p value
2. Visualization
3. Checking the linearity assumptions. 

In the end, we find that **age** and **gender** have an impact on the
spending hours on social media, but we do not have any ***linear
relationship*** between the predictor
variables and the response variable.
