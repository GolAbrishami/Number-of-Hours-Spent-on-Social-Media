# Number of Hours Spent on Social

I and my partners investigated a linear
relationship between different factors and spending hours on
social media. 

We used convenience sampling to create our
dataset. 

We have four different approaches to the hypothesis:
  
1. Age and number of social media accounts as predictors.
2. Aage, number of social media accounts, Occupation, Marital status, Education
3. Age, gender, and a number of social media accounts as the explanatory variables.
4. Gender and age as explanatory variables.

We investigate the relation between the independent variables and the dependent variable in the dataset in three ways:

1. Using the coefficient of determination and p value
2. Visualization
3. Checking the linearity assumptions. 

In the end, we find that **age** and **gender** have an impact on the
spending hours on social media, but we do not have any ***linear
relationship*** between the predictor
variables and the response variable.
